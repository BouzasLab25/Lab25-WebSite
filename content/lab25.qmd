Lab25, located within the Faculty of Psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, investigates the principles by which organisms acquire knowledge about their environment's structure and how this knowledge guides their actions within it. 

We study the solutions, mechanisms, and principles of behavior that enable agents, both biological and artificial, to solve the problem of adaptation to the statistical properties that describe the availability of biologically important events for an organism. The laboratory's primary areas of investigation include Reinforcement Learning, decision-making processes under conditions of temporal constraints and risk, temporal processing, Game Theory, Categorization, and Bayesian Modeling.
