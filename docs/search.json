The laboratory‚Äôs primary areas of investigation include Reinforcement Learning, decision-making processes under conditions of temporal constraints and risk, temporal processing, Game Theory, Categorization, and Bayesian Modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay, 2023 Guest Professor Peter Killeen",

During that time, his interest shifted from the clinical to the experimental area. He obteinend his PhD in Experimental Psychology from Harvard University in 1976, for his work contingencies in instrumental behavior.\nAfter completing his PhD, his interest in the biological processes of behaviour directed him to a post doctoral position in animal behaviour at Toronto University (1977-1978) where he stayed as associate researcher until 1980.\nUpon returning to Mexico, he incorporated as a faculty member at the School of Psychology at UNAM, which he directed from 1997 to 2001. Afterwards, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, San Diego.\nHe is currently a full-time tenured professor, part of the National System of Researchers (second level) and currently holds the Ezequiel A.
