He then pursued studies in Clinical Psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, working in Howard Rachlin‚Äôs laboratory. During this period, his academic focus shifted from clinical to experimental psychology. This new focus led him to Harvard University, where he obtained his PhD in Experimental Psychology in 1976, working in Richard Herrnstein‚Äôs renowned pigeon lab.\nFollowing his PhD, a growing interest in the biological processes of behavior guided him to a postdoctoral position in animal behavior at the University of Toronto (1977-1978). He continued at the University of Toronto as an associate researcher and special lecturer until 1980.\nUpon returning to Mexico, he joined the faculty at the School of Psychology at UNAM, later serving as its Director from 1997 to 2001. He is currently a full-time tenured professor at UNAM and a member of the National System of Researchers (SNI).\nHis research integrates psychology, decision theory, and computational modeling to explore how biological and artificial agents learn, adapt, and make choices. His work encompasses a broad spectrum, from traditional learning theories to contemporary mathematical models of choice and decision-making.",
